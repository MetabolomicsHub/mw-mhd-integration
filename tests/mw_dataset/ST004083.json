The HFD group (60% fat/0.86% methionine) served as the control. Mice were fasted for 4 hours prior to sample collection. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of methionine restriction on plasma, brown adipose, and liver metabolomes.",

The HFD group (60% fat/0.86% methionine) served as the control. Mice were fasted for 4 hours prior to sample collection. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of methionine restriction on plasma, brown adipose, and liver metabolomes.",

            "STUDY_SUMMARY": "25-week-old male mice (n=31) with diet-induced obesity were divided into four groups. The first group (n=8) was fed a high-fat diet (HFD, 60% kcal fat) for 15 weeks. The second, third, and fourth groups were fed a modified high-fat diet (HFD-MetR, 60% fat/0.12% methionine) for 3 days (MetR3, n=8), 5 days (MetR5, n=8), or 10 days (MetR10, n=7), respectively. The HFD group (60% fat/0.86% methionine) served as the control. Mice were fasted for 4 hours prior to sample collection. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of methionine restriction on brown adipose tissues.",
